# XAVIER-GIT-BRANCHING-STRATEGY
 ! [] (images/Xavier-git.png)
* We have divided the git branching strategy into three branches under a single repo which includes master,staging and dev
* We allow the Pull Requests from dev to staging having each developer work in their own fork of the repo created towards dev
* This allows developers to create whatever branches they want without polluting the main fork of the repository.
